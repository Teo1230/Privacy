Harper Lee's ability to address themes of justice and empathy through the eyes of a child is truly remarkable.

Encouraging questions, like “What do you think the author meant by this?” or “How does this relate to our world today?” can spark deeper insights.\n\nAlso, I think personal connections to the text can really elevate a discussion.
